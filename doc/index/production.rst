Notes for a production system:
    - In :code:`backend/aka/settings.py` the :code:`MEDIA_URL` setting points
      to a folder where uploaded files are placed. This folder must exist!
    - The file :code:`backend/aka/local_settings.py` must exist in the same
      folder as :code:`settings.py`, a simple one can be generated by
      :code:`makefile-utils/gen_local_settings.py`, which will print to stdout
    - The frontend is compiled with :code:`npm` and :code:`Vue`, and is placed
      in :code:`frontend/dist` 
      The python settings called :code:`STATIC*` is used to configure the 
      backend to look in the :code:`dist` folder for static files.
      The python file htmlviews.py is used to serve the initial 
      :code:`index.html`, and looks for it in the folder(s) configured in
      :code:`TEMPLATES.DIRS` in the python setting file.
